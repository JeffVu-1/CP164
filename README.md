# <span style="color:#f3c00c;">CP164 Labs & Assignments - Data Structures I</span>
This repo contains my assignments for **CP164**, which is all about Python data structures. In this class, I worked on implementing and understanding various data structures, including:

- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Linked Lists
- Deques (Linked and Array-based)
- Hash Sets (Array-based and BST-based)
- Sorted Lists (Array-based and Linked)
- Priority Queues (Array-based and Linked)
- Queues (Array-based, Circular, and Linked)
- Sorting Algorithms (Array-based and Linked)
- Stack (Array-based and Linked)

The assignments helped me build problem-solving skills while deepening my understanding of how different data structures can be used effectively in Python.
